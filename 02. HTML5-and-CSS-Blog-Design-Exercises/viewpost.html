						<h2>Why Choosing the Right Storage Infrastructure.</h2>
					</header>
					<p>There’s been a fair bit of hype surrounding the latest SpaceX upright rocket landing.
					   Simple as it seems, the excitementSci-Fi Today, Reality TV Tomorrow, at least for me,
					   stems from how the feat has brought us one step closer to fulfilling our sci-fi fantasies
					   – etched into our minds by the many blockbuster flicks Hollywood has produced.
					   If you can recall one of the opening scenes of The Martian, we witnessed the Mars Ascent Vehicle
					   (MAV) lifting off, attempting to escape an ensuing dust storm. While most of the focus was on
					   the misfortune of Mark Watney – played by Matt Damon, left behind after being struck by debris,
					   you could say we took for granted how easily the MAV ascended into space. Combine the thought
					   of how the MAV got there in the first place, and you have yourself a similar parallel to the
					   SpaceX launch and landing. So what am I getting at? Science fiction only remains science fiction
					   until technology catches up with our imagination. This applies not just to space travel,
					   but every other area of technological advancement.Breakthroughs in the Living Room whether we
					   realize it or not, spectacular scientific breakthroughs can be found in the very heart of our
					   homes. Let’s take TVs for example. Ask your grandparents whether they’d have thought color TV
					   was ever possible in the age of black & white screens. In retrospect, many may not have expressed
					   such optimism. Then there were the early 2000s when industry pioneers sold us the idea of being
					   able to spot every blade of grass on the football pitch as the advent of high definition TV
					   dawned upon us. Industry naysayers expressed serious doubt as such a transition would have
					   required a major overhaul to equipment and broadcast standards. From Concept to Ubiquity to
					   Competitiveness - Well, tell that today to any one of Thailand’s seven high definition (HD)
					   digital television channels. Yes, not one but seven. One of which is Amarin TV. It operates a
					   satellite television broadcasting channel, produces television content for free TV channels, and
					   broadcasts edu-tainment content through its Amarin Activ TV channel; all in HD. There are two
					   common issues that plague the delivery of HD content: space and speed. Have you ever tried
					   transferring gigabytes of information from your computer into an external hard drive? If you have,
					   you’ll understand “the wait”. Now imagine, HD content requires a broadcast station to deliver
					   gigabytes of content every few seconds just so you get that impeccable quality on your TV screen.
					   Amarin TV needed a storage solution that would improve the speed of its post-production content
					   editing, deliver reliability, and scale rapidly without causing interruptions to service operations.
					   After implanting an EMC Isilon scale-out network-attached storage (NAS) platform, Amarin improved
					   operational efficiency by up to 10 times and reduced its production costs.“To be competitive,
					   Amarin TV needs high-performance technology. With the EMC Isilon X410, our writing and reading
					   speeds are 400 and 900 megabytes, respectively, per stream. This is incredibly fast compared to
					   current industry standards, and this helps set us apart from our competitors,” says Cheewapat
					   Nathalang, Chief Technical Officer at Amarin TV. Read the Amarin TV Case Study to learn more.
					   Zero Second Tolerance for Slip-ups. When was the last time you saw a blank screen on TV? Many of
					   us take for granted the fluidity of TV programming. Thanks to broadcast specialist providers like
					   Encompass Digital Media, it’s safe to say we are allowed the audacity to continue doing so.
					   Operating out of Singapore, Encompass manages mission-critical content for more than 100 broadcast
					   television channels in the Asia-Pacific region.“Play-to-air is a complex and demanding process.
					   We don’t have the luxury of recalling a file in one or two seconds. It is a real-time process.
					   We need to keep up a continuous flow of data so there are no interruptions in the broadcast. We
					   therefore need a very high-bandwidth continuous data stream. Otherwise we will end up with black
					   holes in our broadcast, which is, of course, unacceptable,” explains Aaron Shaw, Senior Vice President,
					   Operations and Engineering at Encompass. On average, Encompass requires 25 gigabytes of data storage
					   for each program content. That’s the equivalent of close to 20 1080p HD movies. As another adopter
					   of EMC Isilon scale-out NAS, it uses the EMC Isilon OneFS operating system to aggregate all resources
					   into a single pool in order to provide cost-efficient, flexible and reliable broadcast services.
					   Read the Encompass Digital Media Case Study to learn more. Bringing Fantasy and Reality Food for
					   thought: the gap between fantasy and reality can at times be bridged by the simplest of prerequisites. I
					   n this case, it’s storage and its efficient use. Imagination, vision and belief. Never lose sight
					   of these catalysts of progress. For with them, we’ll always find a way forward.
